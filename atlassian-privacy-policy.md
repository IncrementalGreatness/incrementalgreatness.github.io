## Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** December 2025

Incremental Greatness ('we', 'our', or 'us') is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose information when you install and use any of our software applications available on the Atlassian Marketplace (collectively, the 'Apps').

### 1. Architecture and Data Storage (Atlassian Forge)

This App is built using Atlassian Forge, a serverless development platform hosted directly by Atlassian.

**Hosting:** The App's infrastructure and code are hosted on Atlassian's servers. We do not maintain separate external servers to host the application logic.

**Data Storage:** Any data generated or configured by this App is stored within the Atlassian ecosystem using the Forge Storage API. This means your data remains within Atlassian's secure cloud environment and is not transferred to a database owned or managed by Incremental Greatness.

### 2. Information Collection and Use

Because this App runs natively within Atlassian's cloud, our access to your data is strictly limited.

#### A. User Identity

We may process your Atlassian Account ID to identify you as an authorized user, to enforce licensing limits, or to associate specific settings with your user profile. We do not have access to your passwords.

#### B. Jira Content

The App interacts with your Jira content (such as Issues, Projects, and Comments) solely to perform the functions you have installed the App to do. This processing happens instantaneously within the Atlassian cloud. We do not copy, sync, or archive your Jira content to any external storage.

#### C. Analytics and Logs

The App may utilize anonymous usage logging to help us identify errors and improve performance. This data is aggregated and does not contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or sensitive Jira content.

### 3. Data Security

Security is a shared responsibility, but because we use Atlassian Forge, the heavy lifting is done by Atlassian.

**Encryption:** Data processed by the App is protected by Atlassian's encryption standards both in transit and at rest.

**Access Control:** We do not have direct access to your production data. We can only access data strictly necessary to provide support, and only when explicitly granted access by you.

### 4. Data Sharing and Third Parties

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal identification information to others.

The App does not transmit data to any third-party external services or APIs. All processing occurs within the Atlassian Forge environment.

### 5. Your Rights (GDPR)

Since the App stores data within your own Atlassian instance (via Forge Storage), you retain full control over your data.

**Access and Deletion:** You can typically access, update, or delete data generated by the App directly through the Jira user interface.

If you uninstall the App, the data stored by the App within your instance is handled according to Atlassian's data retention policies.
